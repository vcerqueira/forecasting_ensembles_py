    """Mean absolute scaled error.

    This scale-free error metric can be used to compare forecast methods on
    a single
    series and also to compare forecast accuracy between series. This metric
    is well
    suited to intermittent-demand series because it never gives infinite or
    undefined
    values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_test : pandas Series of shape = (fh,) where fh is the forecasting horizon
        Ground truth (correct) target values.
    y_pred : pandas Series of shape = (fh,)
        Estimated target values.
    y_train : pandas Series of shape = (n_obs,)
        Observed training values.
    sp : int
        Seasonal periodicity of training data.

    Returns
    -------
    loss : float
        MASE loss
